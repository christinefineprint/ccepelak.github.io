## Managing social impact programs inspires my current work in data science.

After serving in marginalized communities, <i>I studied sustainable development at the University of Texas at Dallas and the Danish Institute of Study</i> - including grant-funded research focused on data-driven solutions for local homelessness.

These experiences and the subsequent four years spent managing sustainability programs at a high-level in public, private, and higher education organizations <i>showed me the power of data to innovate, inform, and, most importantly, hold groups accountable for their impact on communities. </i>

I am comfortable managing large datasets, engaging technical and non-technical stakeholders, and continuing to learn and connect my past experiences for data-driven impact. Catch up with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/CLcep">Twitter</a>!
